# Sentiment Analysis Model Fine-Tuning Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan for fine-tuning our expanded sentiment analysis model, focusing on improving its performance in the emergency services domain while maintaining its generalization capabilities across other domains.

The current model shows:
- Good general performance (73.53% accuracy) on Twitter data

- Poor performance on emergency services domain (0% on custom examples, 47.5% on emergency services test data)

## Implementation Approach

We will implement a two-pronged approach:

1. **Domain-Specific Model**: Fine-tune a specialized model variant specifically for emergency services content

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Processing Pipeline

```python
# Enhanced preprocessing for emergency services content
def preprocess_emergency_content(text):
    # Normalize emergency terminology
    text = normalize_emergency_terms(text)
    
    # Apply standard preprocessing
    text = remove_special_chars(text)
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    tokens = remove_emergency_stopwords(tokens)
    tokens = lemmatize(tokens)
    
    # Add domain-specific features
    emergency_features = extract_emergency_features(tokens)
    
    return ' '.join(tokens), emergency_features
```

### Domain Classification

```python
# Domain classifier approach
def classify_domain(text):
    features = extract_domain_features(text)
    domain_vector = domain_vectorizer.transform([features])
    domain = domain_classifier.predict(domain_vector)[0]
    confidence = domain_classifier.predict_proba(domain_vector)[0].max()
    
    return {
        'domain': domain,
        'confidence': confidence
    }
```

### Ensemble Model Selection

```python
# Model selection logic
def predict_sentiment(text):
    # Classify domain
    domain_info = classify_domain(text)
    
    # Select appropriate model based on domain
    if domain_info['domain'] == 'emergency' and domain_info['confidence'] > 0.7:
        model = emergency_model
        vectorizer = emergency_vectorizer
        preprocess_fn = preprocess_emergency_content
    else:
        model = general_model
        vectorizer = general_vectorizer
        preprocess_fn = preprocess_text
    
    # Process and predict
    processed_text, extra_features = preprocess_fn(text)
    features = vectorizer.transform([processed_text])
    
    # Add extra features if available
    if extra_features:
        features = hstack([features, extra_features])
    
    # Make prediction
    sentiment = model.predict(features)[0]

2. **Aspect-based sentiment analysis** to identify specific components of emergency responses receiving positive/negative sentiment
3. **Temporal sentiment tracking** to monitor sentiment changes during ongoing emergency situations
4. **Multi-language support** for emergency services sentiment in non-English contexts
