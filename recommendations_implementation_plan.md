# Implementation Plan for Model Enhancements

This document outlines the implementation plan for incorporating the recommendations from the emergency services model report.

## Implementation Tasks

### Domain Classification Component
- [x] Create a domain taxonomy with clear definitions for each emergency service domain
- [x] Develop domain-specific keyword lists for classification
- [x] Implement a multi-label classification approach for domain identification
- [x] Evaluate domain classification accuracy
- [x] Integrate domain classification into the sentiment analysis pipeline
- [x] Implement domain-aware sentiment analysis

### Transfer Learning Exploration
- [x] Research appropriate transformer models for sentiment analysis
- [x] Set up the development environment for transformer models
- [x] Implement data preprocessing for transformer inputs
- [x] Train a basic transformer model on emergency services data
- [x] Evaluate transformer model performance against baseline
- [x] Optimize hyperparameters for best performance
- [x] Document transfer learning implementation and results

### Active Learning Implementation
- [x] Design a feedback collection interface for expert corrections
- [x] Implement a database for storing human-corrected predictions
- [x] Create a model retraining pipeline that incorporates feedback
- [x] Implement uncertainty sampling to identify candidate texts for expert review
- [x] Develop metrics to track model improvement from feedback
- [x] Create a batch process for periodic model updates

### Real-World Validation
- [x] Collect representative emergency service communications samples
- [x] Create a validation framework for real-world testing
- [x] Implement domain-specific evaluation metrics
- [x] Conduct accuracy assessment across different emergency domains
- [x] Analyze error patterns by domain and sentiment
- [x] Document validation results and improvement recommendations

## Timeline and Dependencies

1. Domain Classification (Completed)
   - Prerequisite for domain-aware sentiment analysis

2. Transfer Learning (Completed)
   - Can be developed in parallel with domain classification
   - Required for optimal accuracy

3. Real-World Validation (Completed)
   - Requires both domain classification and improved sentiment model

4. Active Learning (Completed)
   - Can be implemented after initial models are functioning
   - Will provide ongoing improvement

## Evaluation Criteria

- Overall sentiment accuracy improvement of at least 5%
- Domain classification accuracy of at least 90%
- Neutral class F1-score improvement of at least 10%
- Expert feedback incorporation demonstrating incremental accuracy gains
- Documentation of all implementation details and performance metrics
