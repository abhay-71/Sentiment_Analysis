# Sentiment Analysis Application - Detailed Implementation Plan

## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for developing a cost-effective sentiment analysis application for a fire brigade company. The application will analyze incident reports to determine sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) and visualize this data in an interactive dashboard.

## Project Goals

1. Create a system to ingest incident report data
2. Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify report sentiment
3. Build a visualization dashboard for insights
4. Ensure a cost-effective implementation using free-tier services

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a layered architecture:

1. **Data Source Layer**: Mock API providing incident reports
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Script to ingest and store data
3. **Model Layer**: Sentiment analysis model for classification
4. **API Layer**: Serving model predictions
5. **Presentation Layer**: Dashboard for visualizing insights

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### 1. Project Setup

#### 1.1 Environment Setup

- Install required dependencies:
  - Flask (Mock API & Model API)
  - Requests (API communication)
  - SQLite3 (Data storage)
  - Scikit-learn (ML model)
  - Streamlit (Dashboard)
- Set up project structure:
  ```
