# Domain-Aware Sentiment Model Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines a systematic approach to significantly enhance the performance of the domain-aware sentiment analysis model for emergency services communications. Based on the recent evaluation using 40 emergency services test samples, the current model achieved 55% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.5437, with particular challenges in neutral sentiment detection and a tendency to over-predict negative sentiment.

## Current Performance Analysis

| Metric | Current Performance |
|--------|---------------------|
| Overall Accuracy | 55.00% |
| F1 Score | 0.5437 |
| Precision | 0.6100 |
| Recall | 0.5500 |

### Class-Specific Performance

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Negative | 0.4500 | 0.7500 | 0.5625 |
| Neutral | 0.7500 | 0.3750 | 0.5000 |
| Positive | 0.5833 | 0.5833 | 0.5833 |

### Key Issues Identified

1. **Negative Sentiment Bias**: The model over-predicts negative sentiment (20 predictions vs. 12 actual negative samples)
2. **Poor Neutral Class Recognition**: Low recall (0.375) for neutral content
3. **Domain Classification Issues**: Technical errors in domain prediction
4. **Contextual Understanding Limitations**: Struggles with positive statements about successful emergency operations

## Improvement Goals

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Overall Accuracy | 55.00% | ≥75.00% |
| F1 Score | 0.5437 | ≥0.75 |
| Neutral Class F1 | 0.5000 | ≥0.70 |
| Positive Class F1 | 0.5833 | ≥0.75 |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Enrichment and Preparation (2 weeks)

#### 1.1 Domain-Specific Data Collection

- **Emergency Service Success Stories**
  - Collect 500+ positive outcomes from news reports across all emergency domains
  - Focus on fire, police, and EMS domains (currently most frequent in the dataset)
  - Include success metrics, rescue operations, and positive intervention descriptions

- **Neutral Administrative Content**
  - Gather 500+ neutral statements from emergency services bulletins, reports, and official communications
  - Include operational updates, standard procedures, and factual information

- **Balance Negative Examples**
  - Review existing negative examples to ensure proper representation
  - Add 200+ contextually varied negative examples

#### 1.2 Data Annotation and Enhancement

- Implement double-annotation protocol with domain experts
- Create sentiment annotation guidelines specific to emergency services
- Tag emergency-specific sentiment indicators and domain-specific terminology
- Annotate context indicators that determine sentiment (e.g., "in time" as positive marker)

#### 1.3 Create Specialized Test Sets

- Domain-specific test sets for each emergency service type
- Context-specific test sets (e.g., interventions, administrative, training)
- Challenging cases test set based on current error analysis

### Phase 2: Model Architecture Improvements (3 weeks)

#### 2.1 Domain Classification Module Enhancement

- Fix the OneVsRestClassifier prediction issue to enable proper probability outputs
- Implement a hierarchical domain classification approach:
  - Primary domain (fire, police, EMS, etc.)
  - Context type (rescue, administrative, training, etc.)
- Add multi-label capability to handle multiple domains in a single text

#### 2.2 Contextual Feature Extraction

- Implement domain-specific attention mechanisms
- Add bidirectional capability to capture context before and after key sentiment terms
- Extract and weight emergency-specific markers of sentiment:
  - Success indicators: "saved," "rescued," "prevented"
  - Negative indicators: "failed," "injured," "damaged"
  - Neutral indicators: "conducted," "scheduled," "reported"

#### 2.3 Sentiment-Domain Integration

- Create domain-specific sentiment lexicons for each emergency service
- Implement a weighted sentiment scoring system based on domain relevance
- Develop a confidence calibration layer that:
  - Adjusts confidence based on domain-specific patterns
  - Reduces over-confidence in negative predictions
  - Increases confidence for neutral predictions when appropriate

### Phase 3: Training and Optimization (2 weeks)

#### 3.1 Training Methodology

- Implement multi-stage training:
  1. Pre-train domain classifier on expanded domain corpus
  2. Pre-train sentiment classifier on general sentiment data
  3. Fine-tune combined model on domain-specific sentiment data
  4. Final fine-tuning on challenging cases

- Apply class-weighted loss function to:
  - Penalize false negatives for neutral class
  - Reduce negative sentiment bias

#### 3.2 Regularization and Robustness

- Implement dropout (0.3) to prevent overfitting
- Add L2 regularization to the domain-specific layers
- Implement ensemble of domain-specific models with weighted voting

  - Learning rate scheduler
  - Class weights
  - Attention mechanism parameters
  - Ensemble weighting

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Iteration (1 week)

- Analyze performance variations across domains
- Identify remaining weak points in specific contexts
- Calculate domain-specific F1 scores

#### 4.3 Targeted Improvements

- Fine-tune domain-specific submodels for underperforming areas
- Add specialized handling for consistently misclassified phrases
- Implement rule-based overrides for high-confidence errors

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring (Ongoing)

#### 5.1 Deployment Strategy

- Implement A/B testing with the current model
- Deploy domain-specific models alongside unified model
- Create fallback mechanism when confidence is low

- Add expert feedback mechanism in the dashboard
- Create automatic performance monitoring with alerts

#### 5.3 Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

- Document model architecture, training process, and performance characteristics
- Create troubleshooting guide for common failure modes
- Develop user guidelines for interpreting model outputs and confidence scores
