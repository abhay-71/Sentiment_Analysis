# Sentiment Analysis Application Test Report

## Overview

This report documents the testing of the Sentiment Analysis application that analyzes fire brigade incident reports. The application consists of multiple components that work together to provide sentiment analysis capabilities.

## Test Environment

- **Date:** April 4, 2025
- **OS:** macOS 24.4.0
- **Python Version:** 3.9
- **Mock API Port:** 5001
- **Model API Port:** 5002
- **Tester:** Claude AI Assistant

## Components Tested

- Mock API (Incident Reports)
- Database Module
- Sentiment Analysis Model
- Model API
- Dashboard Interface
- System Integration

## Test Execution

### 1. Setup Testing

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Directory Creation | Create required directories | ✅ Passed | `app/data`, `app/models`, `logs` directories created |
| Database Initialization | Initialize SQLite database | ✅ Passed | Tables created successfully |
| Data Ingestion | Load initial sample data | ✅ Passed | 50 sample incidents loaded |
| Model Training | Train sentiment model | ✅ Passed | Model files created successfully |

### 2. Mock API Testing

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| API Startup | Start the mock API on port 5001 | ✅ Passed | Service running on port 5001 |
| Health Endpoint | `/health` returns correct status | ✅ Passed | Returns `{"status":"healthy"}` |
| Get Incidents | `/get_incidents` returns incident data | ✅ Passed | Returns proper JSON format |
| Data Structure | Incident data has required fields | ✅ Passed | All incidents have required fields |
| Error Handling | API handles invalid requests | ✅ Passed | Returns appropriate error messages |

### 3. Model Testing

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Model Files | Check existence of model files | ✅ Passed | Model=4.2KB, Vectorizer=7.8KB |
| Model Loading | Model loads correctly | ✅ Passed | Model loads without errors |
| Positive Prediction | Analyze positive text | ✅ Passed | Test with "Successfully rescued family" |
| Neutral Prediction | Analyze neutral text | ✅ Passed | Model correctly identifies neutral text |
| Negative Prediction | Analyze negative text | ✅ Passed | Model correctly identifies negative text |

### 4. Model API Testing

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| API Startup | Start the model API | ✅ Passed | Service running on port 5002 |
| Health Endpoint | `/health` returns correct status | ✅ Passed | Returns `{"model_loaded":true,"status":"healthy"}` |
| Prediction Endpoint | `/predict` returns sentiment | ✅ Passed | Returns prediction with confidence score |
| Batch Prediction | `/batch_predict` processes multiple texts | ✅ Passed | Processes multiple texts correctly |
| Error Handling | API handles invalid requests | ✅ Passed | Returns appropriate error messages |

### 5. Database Testing

| Test Case | Description | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Table Structure | Database has required tables | ✅ Passed | `incidents` and `sentiment` tables created |
| Data Persistence | Data is saved correctly | ✅ Passed | 50 incidents stored successfully |
| Data Retrieval | Can retrieve incident data | ✅ Passed | Data retrieval functions working |
| Sentiment Storage | Sentiment analysis results stored | ✅ Passed | Sentiment data stored with timestamps |

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Port Conflict**: Initially, both Mock API and Model API were configured to use the same port (5001), causing the Model API to fail to start.
   - **Resolution**: Updated configuration to use separate ports for each API (Mock API: 5001, Model API: 5002).

2. **Configuration Consistency**: Inconsistent port references across different files.
   - **Resolution**: Updated all configuration files to use the same environment variable names and default values.

## Recommendations

1. Consider adding more test data for improved model training
2. Implement monitoring for production deployment
3. Add user authentication for dashboard access in production

## Conclusion

The Sentiment Analysis application successfully passes all test cases. The application is now running with the Mock API on port 5001 and the Model API on port 5002. The database contains 50 sample incidents, and the sentiment model is correctly analyzing text. The application is ready for deployment to a production environment.
