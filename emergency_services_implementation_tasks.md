# Emergency Services Sentiment Analysis - Implementation Tasks

This document outlines the specific implementation tasks for expanding our sentiment analysis model to cover all emergency services, based on the strategy defined in `emergency_services_expansion_plan.md`.

## Phase 1: Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Data Collection Strategy
- [ ] Create list of Twitter hashtags and accounts for each emergency service
- [ ] Identify public sources for emergency reports and news articles
- [ ] Find relevant subreddits and forums for emergency services personnel
- [ ] Create data collection scripts for each source

### 1.2 Template Development
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for police services
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for emergency medical services
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for coast guard/water rescue
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for disaster response teams
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for emergency dispatch
- [ ] Research terminology and scenarios for search and rescue
- [ ] Create base templates for each emergency service (30-50 per service)
- [ ] Develop modifier lists (time, location, outcome) for template variation

### 1.3 Annotation Preparation
- [ ] Create annotation guidelines document
- [ ] Define sentiment criteria specific to emergency services
- [ ] Develop examples for ambiguous cases
- [ ] Create annotation tool/interface (if needed)
- [ ] Recruit annotators or set up self-annotation workflow

## Phase 2: Data Processing (Weeks 3-6)

### 2.1 Dataset Preparation
- [✅] Convert existing Twitter dataset labels (0→-1, 2→0, 4→1)

- [✅] Analyze class distribution across sentiment categories
- [✅] Analyze domain distribution across emergency services
- [✅] Create synthetic neutral class for balanced representation

### 2.2 Synthetic Data Generation
- [ ] Implement template-based data generation pipeline
- [ ] Generate balanced synthetic data for each emergency service

- [ ] Combine synthetic data with real-world data

### 2.3 Data Annotation
- [ ] Pre-label dataset with existing model
- [ ] Set up annotation workflow for manual review
- [ ] Complete first-pass annotation
- [ ] Perform double-annotation for quality control (20% sample)
- [ ] Reconcile disagreements in annotations
- [ ] Create final labeled dataset

### 2.4 Data Analysis
- [✅] Analyze vocabulary distribution across domains
- [✅] Identify domain-specific terminology
- [✅] Create domain-specific stopword lists
